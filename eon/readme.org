* About
This is for the oxadiazole NEB example. Basically the steps being automated are:
- Obtain PET-MAD
- Minimize endpoints (EON)
- Generate IDPP path (ASE)
- Run EON's MMF-NEB (RO-NEB)
- Plot
Conceptually similar to the reproduction done for [1, 2] on Github ([[https://github.com/TheochemUI/gpr_sella_repro][1]], [[https://github.com/HaoZeke/brms_idrot_repro][2]]). We
use ~snakemake~ for this section[fn:: Some of these are inspired by the
workflows of [[https://github.com/amritagos][amritagos]]].

#+caption: DAG for the workflow
[[file:resources/dag.svg]]

Essentially this is as implemented from [3] [[https://github.com/TheochemUI/eOn/pull/77][in EON]] (also [[https://github.com/TheochemUI/eOn/pull/230][here]]), using systems from [4].
** Usage
#+begin_src bash
pixi s -e eon
snakemake -c4 # or c1
# View results/plots/04_plots/roneb.png
#+end_src
If faster experimental visualization is required (compared to editing the ~config/general_config.yaml~) then the ~results~ can be used directly:
#+begin_src bash
cd results/03_neb
python -m rgpycrumbs.cli eon plt_neb --con-file neb.con --plot-structures "crit_points" --facecolor "floralwhite"
#+end_src
